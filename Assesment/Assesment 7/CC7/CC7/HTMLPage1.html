    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>

    <p><strong>Dihydrogen monoxide</strong>, also known as <i>hydroxyl acid</i> or <i>DHMO</i>, is a dangerous substance that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>is the major component of acid rain,</li>
        <li>contributes to the greenhouse effect,</li>
        <li>may cause severe burns,</li>
        <li>is fatal if inhaled,</li>
        <li>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,</li>
        <li>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,</li>
        <li>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,</li>
        <li>and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>as an industrial solvent and coolant,</li>
        <li>in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,</li>
        <li>as a fire retardant,</li>
        <li>in many forms of cruel animal research,</li>
        <li>as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,</li>
        <li>in the distribution of pesticides.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.</p>
    <p>1<sup>1</sup>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
